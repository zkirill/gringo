# mimblewimble-go
Go (Golang) client for MimbleWimble (Grin)


https://github.com/mimblewimble/grin


This is a work in progress. It is currently possible to connect to a seed and perform the first part of the handshake. The client then listens to the seed until interrupted.


Use run.sh to run the app and connect to a seed.
